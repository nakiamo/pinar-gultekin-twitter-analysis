# AI Conversation Summary: Twitter SNA Project

This file summarizes the key steps, decisions, and code snippets from the AI-assisted conversation during the setup and analysis of your Twitter social network analysis (SNA) project.


# This was your first question and follows my answer. Later I summarized the necessary steps in the previous conversation.

I conducted all the analysis before but now I want to start from the stratch to work on the data once more, this time with the help of cursor. So I want to start a clean and very organized process, in a new folder. and with the help of your suggestions im hoping to improve my analysis. Please first guide me how to start the process.



That’s a great approach! Starting fresh and organized will make your analysis more robust, reproducible, and easier to maintain. Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up your new project folder and workflow for a clean, modern, and reproducible R-based social network analysis (SNA) of your Twitter data:
1. Create a New Project Folder
Name it something clear, e.g., twitter-sna-analysis.
Inside, create subfolders for organization:
Apply to ai_conversat...
)
2. Initialize Version Control (Git)
Use Git to track changes. This is best practice for any analysis.
If you’re comfortable, connect to GitHub for backup and collaboration.
3. Create a README File
Document the project’s purpose, data sources, and workflow.
This helps you and others understand the project at a glance.
4. Set Up a Reproducible R Environment
Use a renv or packrat environment, or at least a requirements.R or install_packages.R script to record all package dependencies.
Example install_packages.R:
Apply to ai_conversat...
)
5. Organize Your Scripts
01_load_data.R: Load and clean raw data.
02_preprocess.R: Further cleaning, feature engineering.
03_network_analysis.R: Build and analyze networks.
04_visualization.R: Plots and visualizations.
05_reporting.R: Generate tables, summaries, and export results.
Keep each script focused and modular.
6. Data Management
Place your raw Twitter data in data/raw/.
Save processed/cleaned data in data/processed/.
Never overwrite raw data.
7. Documentation and Notes
Use the docs/ folder for:
Analysis notes
Data dictionary (explain each column)
Methodological decisions
8. Reproducibility
Use RMarkdown or Quarto for analysis reports that combine code, results, and narrative.
Consider a main analysis.Rmd or analysis.qmd that ties everything together.
9. Automation (Optional, Advanced)
Use Makefile or targets package for workflow automation if your analysis gets complex.
10. First Steps in Cursor
Create the folder structure (I can help you with the commands).
Copy your raw data into data/raw/.
Set up your first script: 01_load_data.R to load and inspect your data.
Would you like me to generate the folder structure and starter files for you?
Or do you want to discuss the data loading and cleaning script first?
Let me know your preference, and I’ll guide you step by step!



This summarizes the key steps, decisions, and code snippets from the AI-assisted conversation during the setup and analysis of your Twitter social network analysis (SNA) project.
---

## Project Setup
- Created a new, organized folder structure:
  - `data/raw/`, `data/processed/`, `scripts/`, `output/`, `docs/`
- Initialized a new R project in RStudio.
- Set up version control (recommended: git).
- Added a README and documentation files.

## Data Loading & Documentation
- Loaded all data from `all.data.RData` into the new project.
- Created scripts to:
  - List all dataframes and their sizes
  - Document the structure of each dataframe in Markdown
- Saved documentation in `docs/dataframe_documentation.md`.

## Data Preparation
- Decided to use already-prepared dataframes (`joined.clean`, `retweeted`, `quoted`, `uniques`, etc.) from the old project.
- Skipped redundant cleaning steps.

## Time Series Analysis (pinargultekin)
- Used the original, hourly-aggregated `pinargultekin` dataframe.
- Ensured `tarih` column is in POSIXct format.
- Aggregated to daily, weekly, and monthly levels.
- Plotted and saved:
  - Hourly tweet frequency (for the first 48 hours from `2020-07-19 13:00:00`)
  - Daily, weekly, and monthly tweet frequencies
- Used `scales::label_comma()` for readable y-axis labels.
- Saved all plots in `output/` and data in `data/processed/`.

## Workflow & Best Practices
- Work in the new project folder in Cursor for organization and reproducibility.
- Reference old scripts (e.g., `social-network-analysis.R`) as needed by copying them into the new `scripts/` folder.
- Keep all new data and analysis in the new folder.
- Document all major steps and decisions.

## Conversation Persistence
- This conversation does **not** persist automatically between Cursor sessions or projects.
- To preserve it, save this summary (and any other important details) in your `docs/` folder.
- For future AI sessions, you can copy relevant context from this file.

## Example Code Snippets

**Convert `tarih` to POSIXct:**
```r
pinargultekin <- pinargultekin %>%
  mutate(tarih = as.POSIXct(tarih, tz = "UTC"))
```

**Plot Hourly Tweet Frequency (First 48 Hours):**
```r
start_datetime <- as.POSIXct("2020-07-19 13:00:00", tz = "UTC")
end_datetime <- start_datetime + hours(48)
pinargultekin_48h <- pinargultekin %>%
  filter(tarih >= start_datetime & tarih < end_datetime)

p_hourly_48h <- ggplot(pinargultekin_48h, aes(x = tarih, y = tweet_sayisi)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Hourly Tweet Frequency (First 48 Hours)",
       x = "Date and Hour", y = "Number of Tweets") +
  scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "6 hours", date_labels = "%b %d %H:%M") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_comma()) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
ggsave("output/time_series_hourly_first48h.png", p_hourly_48h, width = 12, height = 6)
```

**Aggregate to Daily, Weekly, Monthly:**
```r
daily <- pinargultekin %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(tarih)) %>%
  group_by(date) %>%
  summarise(tweet_sayisi = sum(tweet_sayisi), .groups = "drop")

weekly <- daily %>%
  mutate(week = floor_date(date, "week")) %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarise(tweet_sayisi = sum(tweet_sayisi), .groups = "drop")

monthly <- daily %>%
  mutate(month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(tweet_sayisi = sum(tweet_sayisi), .groups = "drop")
```
