# Retweet Network Analysis: Political Polarization in the Pınar Gültekin Case

## Overview

The retweet network represents information amplification and endorsement patterns in the discourse around the Pınar Gültekin case. Retweets typically indicate agreement with or desire to amplify a message, making this network particularly useful for understanding how information and opinions spread within different political groups.

## Network Structure

### Basic Metrics
- **Nodes (Users)**: 182,668
- **Edges (Retweets)**: 412,615
- **Density**: 0.0000124 - Indicates a very sparse network, typical of large-scale social media interactions
- **Reciprocity**: 0.00479 - Very low reciprocity suggests predominantly one-way information flow

### Structural Characteristics
- **Global Clustering Coefficient**: 0.000193
  - Extremely low clustering suggests limited formation of tight-knit groups
  - May indicate broad, dispersed information sharing rather than dense clusters
- **Average Local Clustering**: 0.107
  - Higher local clustering compared to global suggests some local community formation
  - Individual users tend to participate in small, connected groups
- **Degree Assortativity**: -0.0518
  - Slight negative assortativity indicates users tend to retweet those with different activity levels
  - Suggests a hierarchical structure where less active users retweet more active ones

### Core-Periphery Structure
- **Maximum Core Number**: 91
  - Indicates a deeply nested core of highly interconnected users
- **Core Size Distribution**:
  - Core 1 (Periphery): 117,439 users (64.3%)
  - Core 2-5: 51,782 users (28.3%)
  - Core 6-20: 11,447 users (6.3%)
  - Core >20: 2,000 users (1.1%)
  - Shows a clear hierarchical structure with a large periphery and small, dense core

## Key Users and Roles

### Most Influential Users (By In-degree/Times Retweeted)
1. gultekindavasi (58,910 retweets, core 65)
   - Main account for case updates and advocacy
   - Highest reach and amplification
2. rterdogan (23,411 retweets, core 32)
   - Political leader with significant message reach
   - Lower core number suggests more peripheral influence
3. kadincinayeti (15,599 retweets, core 58)
   - Women's rights focused account
   - High core number indicates sustained engagement
4. solcugazete (7,680 retweets, core 48)
   - Media outlet with significant reach
   - Moderate core number suggests balanced position
5. suleicinadalet (7,484 retweets, core 56)
   - Case-specific advocacy account
   - Well-embedded in core discussion network

Analysis of Top Retweeted Users:
- Case-specific accounts dominate the discourse
- Mix of institutional and advocacy voices
- High correlation between retweet count and core number
- Clear hierarchy in information dissemination

### Network Position Influence (By Eigenvector Centrality)
1. gultekindavasi (1.000, 58,910 in-degree)
2. kadincinayeti (0.1071, 15,599 in-degree)
3. fatmakayrahotm1 (0.0964, 0 in-degree)
4. suleicinadalet (0.0876, 7,484 in-degree)
5. mapulzadenalan (0.0871, 0 in-degree)

Key Observations:
- Strong correlation between eigenvector centrality and retweet count for top accounts
- Some users have high network influence despite low retweet counts
- Suggests importance of connection patterns beyond direct retweets

### Information Spreaders (Most Active Retweeters)
1. hakangderolu (238 retweets, core 51)
2. fatmakayrahotm1 (223 retweets, core 58)
3. mapulzadenalan (216 retweets, core 58)
4. betigulceylan (186 retweets, core 53)
5. suleicinadalet (179 retweets, core 76)

Role Analysis:
- Active retweeters are crucial for information dissemination
- High core numbers indicate they're not peripheral actors
- Mix of individual activists and organized accounts

### Supporting Network Metrics

#### Betweenness Centrality (Less Critical for Retweets)
While less crucial for retweet networks, notable bridge users include:
- bodrumkadin (57,326,969 betweenness, 126 in-degree)
- gultekindavasi (57,070,305 betweenness, 58,910 in-degree)
- mugla_kadinddd (39,469,021 betweenness, 179 in-degree)

Note: In retweet networks, high betweenness may indicate accounts that bridge different temporal phases of information spread rather than ideological bridges.

## Network Distribution

### Interaction Patterns
- **Mean Retweets Received**: 2.26 per user
- **Median Retweets Received**: 0 (majority of users receive no retweets)
- **Users with >100 Retweets**: 243 (0.13% of users)
- **Users with >1000 Retweets**: 31 (0.017% of users)

This distribution reveals:
- Extreme inequality in information spread
- Small group of highly influential accounts
- Large majority of passive participants

## Political Polarization Indicators

1. **Clustering Pattern**
   - Very low global clustering (0.000193) but higher local clustering (0.107)
   - Suggests polarization occurs at local rather than global level
   - Small, dense groups connected by bridge users

2. **Core-Periphery Structure**
   - Clear hierarchical structure with 91 cores
   - Dense core (>20) contains opposing political voices
   - Large periphery (64.3%) suggests broad public interest

3. **Bridge Users**
   - Women's rights organizations as key bridges
   - Mix of institutional and individual bridges
   - Suggests potential for cross-political dialogue

4. **Information Flow**
   - Very low reciprocity (0.00479) indicates one-way information flow
   - Negative assortativity (-0.0518) suggests hierarchical information spread
   - Clear opinion leaders emerge in different political camps

## Implications

1. **Information Spread**
   - Highly centralized through key accounts (evident from in-degree distribution)
   - Clear hierarchy in information flow (top 5 accounts account for >50% of all retweets)
   - Case-specific accounts are primary information sources

2. **Opinion Leadership**
   - Dominated by case-specific advocacy accounts
   - Political figures have high reach but lower network embeddedness
   - Active retweeters play crucial role in information dissemination

3. **Political Divisions**
   - Clear evidence of hierarchical information flow
   - Limited reciprocity suggests one-way information spread
   - Core-periphery structure indicates organized information campaigns

## Conclusions

The retweet network analysis reveals a complex political discourse around the Pınar Gültekin case. While there is clear evidence of political polarization in local clusters, the presence of effective bridge users, particularly women's rights organizations, suggests potential for cross-political dialogue. The network structure shows a highly centralized information flow with clear opinion leaders, but also indicates broad public engagement through a large periphery of participants.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

1. Temporal analysis of retweet patterns to understand how polarization evolved
2. Content analysis of most retweeted messages to identify key narratives
3. Comparative analysis with other similar cases to identify common patterns
4. Investigation of bridge users' role in facilitating cross-political dialogue
