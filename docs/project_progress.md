# Project Progress: Pınar Gültekin Twitter Analysis

## Latest Update: Text Analysis Phase - Topic Modeling Ready
**Date**: [Current Date]

### Completed Work
1. **Network Analysis Documentation** [COMPLETED]
   - Created comprehensive methodology document
   - Produced detailed analyses for each network type:
     - Retweet network analysis
     - Quote network analysis
     - Reply network analysis
     - Mentions network analysis
     - Whole network analysis
   - Documented core-periphery structure
   - Analyzed political polarization patterns

2. **Text Analysis - Hashtag Analysis** [COMPLETED]
   - Implemented robust hashtag normalization and merging
   - Created comprehensive hashtag frequency analysis
   - Developed hashtag co-occurrence network analysis
   - Produced visualizations for hashtag patterns
   - Saved results to `output/hashtag_counts_final.csv` and `output/hashtag_cooccurrence_network_final.png`

3. **Data Preparation for Topic Modeling** [COMPLETED]
   - Verified `text_analysis_data.RData` contains properly cleaned Turkish text
   - Confirmed `clean.text.2` column is ready for topic modeling
   - Validated that Turkish stopwords have been removed
   - Confirmed text normalization (lowercase, punctuation removal, etc.)

### Current Status
- Network analysis documentation complete
- Hashtag analysis complete with robust merging and co-occurrence analysis
- Text data verified and ready for topic modeling
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Ready to proceed with LDA or STM topic modeling

### Next Steps
- **Immediate**: Implement topic modeling (LDA or STM) on Turkish text data
- **Options**: 
  - LDA topic modeling (simpler, good for initial exploration)
  - STM (Structural Topic Modeling) if we want to include metadata like time or user characteristics
- **Future**: Sentiment analysis with Turkish lexicon

### Notes for Next Session
- Data is ready for topic modeling - use `clean.text.2` column from `text_analysis_data.RData`
- Consider Turkish-specific topic modeling considerations
- Update text analysis methodology as we progress
- Consider sentiment analysis after topic modeling

## Current Focus
- Topic modeling implementation on Turkish text data
- Building on completed hashtag analysis
- Preparing for sentiment analysis

## Next Steps
1. Implement topic modeling (LDA or STM)
2. Update text analysis methodology with topic modeling results
3. Begin sentiment analysis with Turkish lexicon
4. Update methodology documents as analyses progress

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Remember to check this file at the start of each session
- Update progress markers as tasks are completed
- Add new tasks and components as they arise
- Document any major decisions or changes

## Important Decisions Log

### Network Analysis
- Switched from PageRank to eigenvector centrality
- Implemented separate analysis for different network types
- Created composite influence score with weighted components

### Time Series Analysis
- Focused on four time scales: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
- Implemented consistent visualization style across time scales
- Used first 168 hours for detailed initial response analysis
- Standardized datetime handling with UTC

### Text Analysis
- Implemented robust hashtag normalization using `stri_trans_general` for Turkish characters
- Created comprehensive hashtag merging logic with `case_when`
- Fixed hashtag co-occurrence analysis using proper grouping and `reframe()`
- Verified data readiness for topic modeling

### Sentiment Analysis
[To be added]

## Reference Points
- Network analysis methodology is complete and can be used as a template
- Time series analysis provides temporal context for other analyses
- Text analysis data is verified and ready for topic modeling
- Each analysis should have its own methodology document
- Keep documentation updated as analyses progress

## Session History
