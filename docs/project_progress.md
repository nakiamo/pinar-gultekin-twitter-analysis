# Project Progress: Pınar Gültekin Twitter Analysis

## Latest Update: Network Analysis Documentation
**Date**: [Current Date]

### Completed Work
1. **Network Analysis Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive methodology document
   - Produced detailed analyses for each network type:
     - Retweet network analysis
     - Quote network analysis
     - Reply network analysis
     - Mentions network analysis
     - Whole network analysis
   - Documented core-periphery structure
   - Analyzed political polarization patterns

2. **Methodological Framework**
   - Established centrality measure priorities for each network type
   - Documented analytical decisions
   - Created reference for future analysis

3. **Key Findings**
   - Identified three major clusters in the network
   - Discovered important bridge users
   - Analyzed communication patterns
   - Found potential for cross-political dialogue

### Current Status
- Network analysis documentation complete
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Ready for next phase of analysis

### Next Steps
- Awaiting direction on next analysis focus
- Potential areas for further investigation:
  - Temporal analysis of network evolution
  - Content analysis of cross-cluster communication
  - Bridge user role development
  - Intervention strategies

- [ ] Sentiment analysis results

## Current Focus
- Completing network analysis results interpretation
- Interpreting time series analysis results
- Preparing for text analysis

## Next Steps
1. Complete network analysis results documentation
2. Write time series analysis results interpretation
3. Begin text analysis implementation
4. Update methodology documents as analyses progress

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Remember to check this file at the start of each session
- Update progress markers as tasks are completed
- Add new tasks and components as they arise
- Document any major decisions or changes

## Important Decisions Log

### Network Analysis
- Switched from PageRank to eigenvector centrality
- Implemented separate analysis for different network types
- Created composite influence score with weighted components

### Time Series Analysis
- Focused on four time scales: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly
- Implemented consistent visualization style across time scales
- Used first 168 hours for detailed initial response analysis
- Standardized datetime handling with UTC

### Text Analysis
[To be added]

### Sentiment Analysis
[To be added]

## Reference Points
- Network analysis methodology is complete and can be used as a template
- Time series analysis provides temporal context for other analyses
- Each analysis should have its own methodology document
- Keep documentation updated as analyses progress

## Session History
1. Initial network analysis setup
2. Community detection implementation
3. Centrality measures refinement
4. Network analysis documentation and methodology consolidation
5. Time series analysis implementation and documentation
